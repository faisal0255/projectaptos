## Vision

The **TokenExchange** smart contract enables users to swap tokens through a decentralized exchange pool. The contract manages token reserves and ensures seamless swaps based on a predefined exchange rate, promoting decentralized token trading without intermediaries.

## Features

- **Initialize Exchange Pool**:
  - Users can initialize a pool with reserves of two tokens and set an exchange rate for swapping between them.
- **Swap Tokens**:
  - Users can swap Token A for Token B at the exchange rate, with the pool ensuring sufficient reserves for the transaction.

## Future Scope

1. **Dynamic Exchange Rates**:

   - Implement dynamic exchange rates based on market demand and liquidity in the pool.

2. **Liquidity Provision**:

   - Allow users to provide liquidity to the pool and earn a share of the transaction fees.

3. **Multi-Token Swaps**:
   - Extend support to swap between multiple types of tokens within the same pool.

The **TokenExchange** contract creates a decentralized and transparent method for swapping tokens, supporting a robust and efficient trading ecosystem.
